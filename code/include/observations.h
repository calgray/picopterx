    I want a computationally efficient model for uncertainty.
    If I wanted an accurrate model for uncertainty, I'd use a voxel system with block density following probability density gradient
        Such a system (I expect) would chew on truly vast quantities of memory and computing power
    This code runs on an ellipsoidal gaussian structure

    a 3d gaussian elliptical structure: (treat as a probability density function PDF)
        p = e^-(ax^2 + by^2 + cz^2 + dyz + ezx + fxy + g)
    The semi-major axes are encoded with
        a,b,c, and d,e,f
    the centre of the ellipse the stationary point of the polynomial
        ax^2 + by^2 + cz^2 + dyz + ezx + fxy + g
    combining independent measurements of an object location is dine by multiplying PDFs, or in this case, summing polynomials.

    For the sake of sanity and legibility, converting to matrix definition.
        This increases the complexity of combining observations, but not by much.
        It also keeps the transforation matrices at 3x3 instead of 10x10 so the opencv API is friendlier
